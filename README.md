The top-level directory contains four subdirectories, one for each project or course. The projects are contained within the `Exercises` directory, and each course is contained within its own directory (`Alura Courses`, `Drupalize.me`, and `Udemy`).

## Getting Started

To get started with one of the projects from the `Exercises` directory, navigate to the subdirectory and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The projects are static web pages and do not require any additional setup.

To access the courses, navigate to the subdirectory and choose a course directory. Each course directory contains its own materials and instructions on how to get started.
