Database Integration:
Now that we have our database tables all set up, it's time to create a Stub
function to define how the data gets added to our new table when a user signs
up.
The database substration layer allows the usage of different database servers
to use the same base code to manage data.

- Add signup data to the database
function db_insert db_insert($table, array $options=array())

Parameters:
string $table: The table into which to insert.
array $options: An array of options to control how the query operates.
