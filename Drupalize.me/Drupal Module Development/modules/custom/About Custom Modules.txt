With custom modules, we learned the essentials of adding a new module to
extend or alter Drupal's functionality.

- The project name you specify should be unique, it becomes the machine name
  for your module
- Use the exact machine name to key your folder, file and function names
- Your project folder must exist in a module's directory in your codebase
- Best practices suggest you create custom and contrib subfolders to organize
  your projects
- Two files are required to be recongnized as a module: .info and .module
    - .info.yml declares information to Drupal
    - .module will hold many of your hook functions definitions

Understanding hooks in one of the keys to creating Drupal modules. Almost
every phase of Drupal's page building process can be intercepted and the data
modified.

Using Drupal's API as a reference helps you understand how to implement the
hooks you need.
