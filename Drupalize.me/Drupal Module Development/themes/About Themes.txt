What is an Info File?

Info files are used to provide Drupal the metadata about the theme (eg. The
name and description that are presented to users when administer themes in the
user interface. Or the version of Drupal core the theme is compatible with.).
The file name is the internal name of the theme, which also means there are
some restrictions that apply:
- lowercase
- alphanumeric
- starts with a letter
- spaces replaced with an underscore "_"
- unique (theme, module or installation profile already in use by the project)
- .info.yml extension required

Info files also give the theme their machine readable name, or the name that
will be used to refer to the theme internally by Drupal, and in code.

Info files are written in YAML, and consist of a combination of a few required
key/value pairs, and a few optional ones. There are 4 properties that are
required:
- name
- description
- core
- type

Info files are the only required component of a theme. This is all we need to
have Drupal recognize and install the theme.

Info files must be in the root directory of the theme that they belong to.
