# React Course: Writing with Typescript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project is a React app written in Typescript. The app was created from scratch using Create React App, and it covers fundamental React concepts such as Componentization, Props, and State. It also includes best practices such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and run the following commands:
<br />

`npm install`
<br />

`npm start`
<br />

This will install all the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Concepts Covered

* Componentization
* Props
* State
* CSS Modules
* useState hook
* useEffect hook
* Class components vs. Function components
* Clean and documented code

## Best Practices

* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

## Credits

This project was created based on the "React Course: Writing with Typescript" course by [Luiz Fernando Ribeiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lfrprazeres/) at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/). If you want to learn more about React and Typescript, I highly recommend this course!
